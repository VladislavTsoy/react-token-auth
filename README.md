# react-token-auth

Part 1:
    This section will implement the server side logic neede to handle token authentication in React

Part 2:
    This section will involve creating the authentication functions needed on the front-end so that we can interact with our signup and login routes we made in part 1.  This will allow us to login as a user, create posts, and only see posts created by that specific user.

Part 3:
    This section is to add more security and a better user experience.  This includes encrypting the user's password before saving it our database, and creating protected routes/error handling on the front end so user's can only navigate on our site when they are authenticated.
